## 📦 API Endpoints (Expected)

Your backend should expose the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint         | Description              |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| POST   | `/api/tasks`     | Create a new task        |
| GET    | `/api/tasks`     | Get all tasks            |
| PUT    | `/api/tasks/:id` | Toggle completion status |
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/:id` | Delete a task            |

> Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Buy milk","description":"From store"}'
```
